# Biblioteca
This is a small project I was required to do for school.
It basically is a data structure called "biblioteca", which directly translates to library, which manages books.
It has various methods such as binary searching books off of their IDs, off of authors and much more.
Also returns the books which are closest to the number of pages & ID searched in case we didn't find it.
Built in C++ because C++ is simply the fastest programming language out there.
